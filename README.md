# Coboli
Coboli is a comic viewer app for android that uses [ComicLib](https://github.com/ahahn94/ComicLib) as a server to organize comics.
The name Coboli stands for **Co**mic **Bo**ok **Li**brary.

## Disclaimer

This software is still in alpha stage. It contains all features planned for version 1 and passed basic testing (using the ComicLib example library).
It is currently in extended testing (testing against my private library to find bugs that may not occur when using the example library).
This readme will be updated at the time version 1 is released.

### Todo before release of version 1.0
- [x] Core features
- [x] German and english translation of the app
- [x] Basic testing
- [ ] Extended testing
- [ ] Improve downloads
- [ ] Improve loading of images in the volumes and publishers view
- [ ] Replace JUnRAR with UnRAR (no support for RAR >= version 5 in JUnRAR; requires Android NDK because of C++ code)
